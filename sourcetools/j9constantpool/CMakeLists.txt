# CMake uses ':' as the path separator when building in cygwin which isn't
# appropriate for a Windows java executable (which expects path elements to
# be separated by ';'). In JDK11+, fixpath.sh will compensate, but for JDK8,
# we need to put the classpath in a file in a form that fixpath will support.
