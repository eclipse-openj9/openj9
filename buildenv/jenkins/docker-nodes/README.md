# Docker
## About
Dockerfiles are used to define how a docker container/image
should be built. Docker containers are essentially virtual
machines designed for short term use. This makes them very
useful for testing purposes as you can generate a new container
for every test and you are guaranteed to run against the
same environment every time.

## Eclipse OpenJ9 CI
Generated Dockerfiles are used by two Jenkins jobs at Eclipse to
build docker images. The first [job](https://openj9-jenkins.osuosl.org/job/Build-Jenkins-Agent-Container/) is run manually
by supplying the architecture and os. It should be run after
changes to mkdocker.sh have been merged. The second [job](https://openj9-jenkins.osuosl.org/job/PullRequest-Build-Jenkins-Agent-Container/) is used
to test pull requests. Whenever a PR makes changes to mkdocker.sh,
a PR build should be launched for each affected architecture and os combination. A PR
build can be launched by making a comment in the PR with the following format
```
Jenkins build docker <ARCH> <OS>
```
Both jobs will push the Docker images to Docker Hub under the repo
`eclipseopenj9/jenkins-agent-<ARCH>-<OS>:<TAG>`
If a manual build is run the tag will be the build number of
the job, as well as the `latest` tag. If a PR build is run the
tag will contain `PR` followed by the ID of the pull request used to
build the job.
## Using containers from a terminal
If you have [docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/) then you can run
`docker pull eclipseopenj9/jenkins-agent-<ARCH>-<OS>:<TAG>` to pull
a docker image of the specified architecture and os.
You can use `docker run -it eclipseopenj9/jenkins-agent-<ARCH>-<OS>:<TAG> /bin/bash`
to start up a new container and enter it. Once inside of a
container, run `su - jenkins` to switch to the jenkins user.
This way when you run your code you won't have root privileges.
If the container is capable of building openj9 it will also have
reference repos and bootJDKs. The reference repos can be used to
improve clone times, and the bootJDKs can be used for compiling
openj9. The locations of the reference repos and bootJDKs can be
found [here](https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/blob/master/buildenv/jenkins/variables/defaults.yml).
A full list of docker commands for managing/using containers can
be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/docker/).
## Docker and Jenkins
There is a Docker plugin for Jenkins which allows Jenkins to
orchestrate running Docker containers on remote machine(s). Details
of the plugin can be found [here](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-plugin). After the plugin is installed,
you need a machine with Docker installed, and [enable its remote API](https://medium.com/@sudarakayasindu/enabling-and-accessing-docker-engine-api-on-a-remote-docker-host-on-ubuntu-16-04-2c15f55f5d39).
In the Jenkins Configure System page under the Cloud section, add
a new Docker Cloud. Fill in the details for the remote host and add
one or more Agent templates with the appropriate details. Add the
labels as you would a normal agent. Additionally add label `hw.arch.docker`
to indicate that the agent is running inside a container.
