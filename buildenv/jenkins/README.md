- OpenJ9 committers can request builds by commenting in a pull request
    - Format: `Jenkins <build type> <level>.<group>[+<test_flag>] <platform>[,<platform>,...,<platform>] jdk<version>[,jdk<version>,...,jdk<version>]`
    - `<build type>` is compile | test
    - `<level>` is sanity | extended (required only for "test" `<build type>`)
    - `<group>` is functional | system
    - `<test_flag>` Optional: any TEST_FLAG is supported. See notes below.
    - `<platform>` is one of the platform shorthands above
    - `<version>` is the number of the supported release, e.g. 8 | 11 | next
- Note: You can use keyword `all` for platform but not for test level/type or JDK versions.
- Note: For backward compatibility `<level>.<test type>` equal to `sanity` or `extended` is acceptable and will map to `sanity.functional` and `extended.functional` respectively.
- Note: TEST_FLAG is an optional argument to the test target. It is recommended to only launch 1 test target with 1 TEST_FLAG per comment/build. At the time of writing, the two supported test flags are `+jitaas` and `+aot`. Ex. `Jenkins test sanity.functional+jitaas xlinux jdk8`.

###### Examples
- Request a Compile-only build on all platforms and multiple versions by commenting in a PR
    - `Jenkins compile all jdk8,jdk11`
- Request a sanity functional build on zLinux and multiple versions
    - `Jenkins test sanity.functional zlinux jdk8,jdk11`
- Request an extended functional and system build on pLinux for a single version
    - `Jenkins test extended.functional,extended.system plinux jdk8`
- Request a sanity build on z,p Linux for multiple versions
    - `Jenkins test sanity zlinux,plinux jdk8,jdk11`
- Request sanity.system test on all platforms and multiple versions
    - `Jenkins test sanity.system all jdk8,jdk11`

You can request a Pull Request build from the Eclipse OpenJ9 repository - [openj9](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9) - or the Extensions OpenJDK\* for Eclipse OpenJ9 repositories:

- openj9-openjdk-jdk: https://github.com/ibmruntimes/openj9-openjdk-jdk
- openj9-openjdk-jdk`<version>`: `https://github.com/ibmruntimes/openj9-openjdk-jdk<version>`

##### Dependent Changes

- If you have dependent change(s) in either eclipse/omr, eclipse/openj9-omr, or ibmruntimes/openj9-openjdk-jdk\*, you can build & test with all needed changes
- Request a build by including the PR ref or branch name in your trigger comment
- Ex. Dependent change in OMR Pull Request `#123`
    - `Jenkins test sanity xlinux jdk8 depends eclipse/omr#123`
- Ex. Dependent change in eclipse/omr master branch (useful if a dependent OMR PR is already merged)
    - `Jenkins test sanity xlinux jdk8 depends eclipse/omr#master`
- Ex. Dependent change in OpenJ9-OMR Pull Request `#456`
    - `Jenkins test sanity xlinux jdk8 depends eclipse/openj9-omr#456`
- Ex. Dependent change in OpenJDK Pull Request `#789`
    - `Jenkins test sanity xlinux jdk8 depends ibmruntimes/openj9-openjdk-jdk8#789`
- Ex. Dependent changes in OMR and OpenJDK
    - `Jenkins test sanity all jdk8 depends eclipse/omr#123 ibmruntimes/openj9-openjdk-jdk8#789`
- Ex. If you have a dependent change and only want one platform, depends comes last
    - `Jenkins test sanity zlinux jdk8 depends eclipse/omr#123`

###### Note: When specifying a dependent change in an OpenJDK extensions repo, you can only build the SDK version that matches the repo where the dependent change lives. Eg. You cannot build JDK8 with a PR in openj9-openjdk-jdk11.

##### Testing Changes to Pipeline code

- If you have changes to Jenkins Pipeline code (including the defaults.yml variable file), you can test most code paths via a PR build. Your PR build will load the Pipeline code from your PR (merge ref). Also note if you have dependent changes you have to launch your PR build through the OpenJ9 repo in order for the Pipeline changes to be loaded in your build.

##### Other Pull Requests builds

- To trigger a Line Endings Check
   - `Jenkins line endings check`

- To trigger a Copyright Check
   - `Jenkins copyright check`

- To trigger a SignedOffBy Check (Only applicable to the Extensions repos)
   - `Jenkins signed off by check`

### Jenkins Pipelines

In this section:
- `<platform>` is the full spec name eg. ppc64_aix
- `<repo>` is the Eclipse OpenJ9 repository or an Extensions OpenJDK\* for Eclipse OpenJ9 repository, e.g. OpenJ9 | OpenJDK`<version>`

#### Pull Requests

Pull Requests for all platforms and versions are available [**here**](https://ci.eclipse.org/openj9/view/Pull%20Requests/).

For Compile & Test PRs, there is a single top level job (for each repository) that connects Jenkins and the Github repo.
This job will trigger downstream jobs based on what is requested in the pull request trigger comment (ghprbCommentBody)

- PullRequest-`<repo>`
    - Description:
        - Setup job that launches downstream Pipeline job(s)
    - Trigger:
        - Github PR comment `Jenkins (compile|test).*`

Other PR jobs

- PullRequest-LineEndingsCheck-`<repo>`
    - Description:
        - Checks the files modified in a pull request have correct line endings
    - Trigger:
        - Automatically builds on every PR
        - Retrigger with `Jenkins line endings check`

- PullRequest-CopyrightCheck-`<repo>`
    - Description:
        - Checks the files modified in a pull request have copyright with current year
    - Trigger:
        - Automatically builds on every PR
        - Retrigger with `Jenkins copyright check`

- PullRequest-signedOffByCheck-`<repo>`
    - Description:
        - Checks the commits in a pull request have proper sign-off
    - Trigger:
        - Trigger with `Jenkins signed off by check`

#### Pipelines

Pipelines for all platforms and versions are available [**here**](https://ci.eclipse.org/openj9/view/Pipelines/).

- Any platform and version pipeline:
    - Name: Pipeline-Build-Test-JDK`<version>`-`<platform>`
    - Description:
        - Compile Eclipse OpenJ9 on `<platform>` for Extensions OpenJDK`<version>` and run sanity & extended test suites
        - Triggers:
            - Build-JDK`<version>`-`<platform>`
            - Test-`<sanity|extended>.<functional|system>`-JDK`<version>`-`<platform>`

- Always add pipeline style jobs so the code can be committed to the repo once it is ready
- Update this readme when your build is in production use
- Whenever possible, reuse existing builds or existing jenkins files
