# About
Artifactory is a binary repository manager.
Our server is being used to store the Jenkins artifacts between builds to save space on the Jenkins Manager node. The artifacts will be kept for a period after the job in case someone needs to debug the build.
It is being hosted on the proxy worker machine and the current address is https://140-211-168-230-openstack.osuosl.org/artifactory/webapp/

# Install Artifactory:

Download Artifactory from JFrog (https://jfrog.com/open-source/)

`https://api.bintray.com/content/jfrog/artifactory/jfrog-artifactory-oss-$latest.zip;bt_package=jfrog-artifactory-oss-zip`

Once Artifactory is downloaded, unzip the file to a directory.

`unzip jfrog-artifactory-oss-zip -d /home/jenkins/artifactory`

Edit the file in /home/jenkins/artifactory/etc/binarystore.xml and create the following configuration

```
<config version="1">
    <chain template="file-system"/>
    <provider id="file-system" type="file-system">
        <baseDataDir>/home/jenkins/artifact_storage/data</baseDataDir>
        <fileStoreDir>/home/jenkins/artifact_storage/filestore</fileStoreDir>
        <tempDir>/home/jenkins/artifact_storage/temp</tempDir>
    </provider>
</config>
```

Edit the Artifactory defaults values `/home/jenkins/artifactory/bin/artifactory.default`
```
export ARTIFACTORY_HOME=/home/jenkins/artifactory/artifactory-oss-6.5.2
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-ppc64el
```
Also for the UNB setup, Artifactory was complaining that `-Xss` should be set to greater than default 256k. I set it to 512k.

# Reverse Proxy
Next is to install a reverse proxy. In this case, NGINX was installed
A Reverse Proxy was used so that https can be configured.

To install NGINX use this command
` sudo apt install nginx`

Then the reverse configuration needs to be set.
The template for the reverse proxy was taken from https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Configuring+NGINX and there were some changes to it.
This is the copy that is currently being used

`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/artifactory.conf`
```

    server_name 140-211-168-230-openstack.osuosl.org;

```
All of the lines with the `# managed by Certbot` were added when adding in the ssl certificate.

Those lines do not need to be added as they were automatically added by certbot

I am getting my certificate from Let's Encrypt and their install tool certbot. Firstly, I installed certbot:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot python-certbot-nginx
```
Then I used the certbot automated script to add the certificates and to automatically renew the certificates:
```
sudo certbot --nginx
```
Follow the onscreen instructions and everything should work out.

UNB uses a self-signed certificate. Because it is behind a VPN, Let's Encrypt can't auth the cert.

Create the keys
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-apache-in-ubuntu-18-04
```
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 99999 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/apache-selfsigned.crt
```
Update the 2 files above with the key and crt generated from the above command.

Useful nginx commands
```
service nginx start
```
```
service nginx reload
```

# Open the Ports
Log into OpenStack (https://openpower-controller.osuosl.org/auth/login/?next=/project/) and go to network security groups
Click on `http` (if it is not created, create the rule)
Create a new rule with these settings
```
Custome TCP Rule
Ingres
Port
443
CIDR
0.0.0.0/0
```
Create another rule for port 80 if you enabled port forward in the certbot step

Then go to compute -> instances and click on ` eclipse-openj9-proxy`

Edit instance -> security group
Add http to the instance security groups

# Configure Artifactory
To start the Artifactory server, run the command:
```
/home/jenkins/artifactory/artifactory-oss-6.5.2/bin/artifactoryctl start
```

On your local browser, go to `http://140-211-168-230-openstack.osuosl.org/` and follow the onscreen instructions.
The admin password is in the secrets repo and the repository that is used is 'generic' with the name being "ci-eclipse-openj9".

Next, click on the `Welcome, admin` tab and select `Add User`
Insert the username `Jenkins` and the email address `j9build@ca.ibm.com`. Insert the password as indicated in the secrets file.

Now click on the `Welcome, admin` tab and select `Add Permission`
Give the permission a name like `Jenkins-perm` and include the `ci-eclipse-openj9` repository. Click on Users and then add Jenkins. Give Jenkins all of the permissions except manage and save.

Under the Admin tab on the left side, select Services -> Backups and make sure that they are disabled. To see if they are disabled, click on the backup and see if the enabled button is checked. If it is, uncheck it and save. The backups take up too much memory for what ends up being needed.

Under the Admin tab on the left side, select Configuration -> General Configuration. Disable trash can. Save.

Admin tab, Advanced, Maintenance. Garbage collection. Cron expression. Set to 9pm daily (Before the nightly, after the daily cleanup). `0 0 1 * * ?` for OSU (UTC) and `0 0 21 * * ?` for UNB (EDT). Save. The GC will give back the disk space to the OS after artifacts are deleted. See https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Managing+Disk+Space+Usage

Now logoff of the admin account and log into the Jenkins account. Edit the profile of Jenkins by clicking on Welcome, Jenkins -> Edit Profile. Insert the password to unlock the account and generate the API key. Copy that key to the secrets repo and update Jenkins so that it can upload artifacts.

I also added in a separate shell command to restart Artifactory.
The command is artifactory_restart.sh and contains
```
#!/bin/bash

/home/jenkins/artifactory/artifactory-oss-6.5.2/bin/artifactoryctl stop
/home/jenkins/artifactory/artifactory-oss-6.5.2/bin/artifactoryctl start
```
A cron job was later added to call this command @midnight
The command used is `crontab -e`
This line was added
```
@reboot bash /home/jenkins/artifactory/artifactory-oss-6.5.2/bin/artifactory_restart.sh
```

# Configure UNB nodes for curl redirection

Create a curl wrapper to redirect OSU requests to UNB. Also strip off user info as the creds will be wrong for the UNB server. Take note of what is default curl before you override.
```
/usr/local/bin/curl
```
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Entering curl wrapper for UNB machines..."
echo "Redirecting OSU artifactory artifactory downloads from UNB artifactory mirror"
for var in "$@"
do
  if [[ $var = https* ]]
  then
    echo "Original parameter: $var"
    echo "Modified to UNB mirror: `echo $var | sed 's#140-211-168-230-openstack.osuosl.org#192.168.10.216#'`"
  fi
done
echo $@ | sed 's#--user .*:.* ##' | xargs /usr/bin/curl --resolve 140-211-168-230-openstack.osuosl.org:443:192.168.10.216
```

# Configure UNB nodes to accept self-signed certificate (upload only)

UNB nodes uploading to UNB Artifactory need to trust the self signed cert. Curl doesn't need it for download since we use the -k option to ignore the cert.
https://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/how-to-import-a-public-ssl-certificate-into-a-jvm-867025849.html

```
openssl s_client -connect 192.168.10.216:443 -servername ub18p8art.casa.cs.unb.ca:443 < /dev/null | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > public.crt
```
Substitute whatever JAVA_HOME the node agent is running.
```
/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin/keytool -import -alias ub18p8art.casa.cs.unb.ca -keystore /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file public.crt
```
```
Enter keystore password:changeit
```
```
Trust this certificate? [no]: y
```
