/**
 * Creates a process and returns an opaque cookie representing the created process to be passed into 
 * other j9process functions.
 * 
 * The opaque cookie is an interally-declared J9ProcessHandle structure. Storage for the J9ProcessHandle 
 * struct is created here; any resources it holds onto are destroyed by @ref j9process_close(). 
 * 
 * Inheritable handles vary on a per-platform basis and are inherited by the child process, 
 * except for stdout, stderr and stdin which are represented by the port library flags 
 * J9PORT_PROCESS_STDOUT, J9PORT_PROCESS_STDERR, J9PORT_PROCESS_STDIN respectively. 
 * These standard handles are accessible by @ref j9process_getStream
 *
 * @param[in] 	portLibrary The port library
 * @param[in] 	command An array of NULL-terminated strings representing the command line to be executed,
 * 				where command[0] is the executable name
 * @param[in] 	commandLength The number of elements in the command line where by convention the first
 * 				element is the file to be executed
 * @param[in] 	env A pointer to the environment block for the new process
 * @param[in] 	envSize The number of environment variables in the environment block
 * @param[in] 	dir The full path to the directory which contains the new process
 * @param[in] 	options Bitmap used for additional options, 0 may be used for defaults
 *		J9PORT_PROCESS_IGNORE_OUTPUT
 *				ignores the child process' output, the pipes that capture J9PORT_PROCESS_STDOUT and
 *				J9PORT_PROCESS_STDERR are not created
 *		J9PORT_PROCESS_NONBLOCKING_IO
 *				Sets the J9PORT_PROCESS_STDIN, J9PORT_PROCESS_STDOUT and J9PORT_PROCESS_STDERR pipes
 *				to non-blocking
 *	 	J9PORT_PROCESS_PIPE_TO_PARENT
 *	 			Indicates that child process I/O will be connected to the parent process over a pipe.
 *	 			This is the default handling of child process standard I/O.
 *		J9PORT_PROCESS_INHERIT_STDIN
 *				Indicates that child process J9PORT_PROCESS_STDIN will be the same as those of the parent
 *				process. This is the normal behavior of most operating system command interpreters (shells).
 *		J9PORT_PROCESS_INHERIT_STDOUT
 *				Indicates that child process J9PORT_PROCESS_STDOUT will be the same as those of the parent
 *				process. This is the normal behavior of most operating system command interpreters (shells).
 *		J9PORT_PROCESS_INHERIT_STDERR
 *				Indicates that child process J9PORT_PROCESS_STDERR will be the same as those of the parent
 *				process. This is the normal behavior of most operating system command interpreters (shells).
 *		J9PORT_PROCESS_REDIRECT_STDERR_TO_STDOUT
 *				Merges the child process J9PORT_PROCESS_STDERR into J9PORT_PROCESS_STDOUT.
 *		J9PORT_PROCESS_CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP
 *				Create the child in a new process group. An intended side-effect is that the child will not
 *				be killed if CTRL + C is issued in the console of the parent process.
 * @param[in] j9fdInput The file descriptor for standard input source
 * 				obtained via the j9file port library API or
 *				J9PORT_INVALID_FD to indicate that no file descriptor is being provided.
 * @param[in] j9fdOutput The file descriptor for standard output destination
 * 				obtained via the j9file port library API or
 *				J9PORT_INVALID_FD to indicate that no file descriptor is being provided.
 * @param[in] j9fdError The file descriptor for standard error destination
 * 				obtained via the j9file port library API or
 *				J9PORT_INVALID_FD to indicate that no file descriptor is being provided.
 * @param[out] processHandle Opaque struct to be passed to other j9process operations
 * 
 * pass J9PORT_INVALID_FD(-1) for file descriptor
 *
 * When both a valid file descriptor and flag were passed, flag setting overrides file descriptor check.
 *
 * @return 0 on success, otherwise negative error code
