/**
 * @file
 * @ingroup Port
 * @brief Shared Resource Mutex
 *
 * The J9IPCMutex is used to protect a shared resource from simultaneous access by processes or threads executing in the same or different VMs.
 * Each process/thread must request and wait for the ownership of the shared resource before it can use that resource. It must also release the ownership
 * of the resource as soon as it has finished using it so that other processes competing for the same resource are not delayed.
