/*
 * A messages subscriptions value starts with a value of untagged prior to being queued and undergoes the
 * following atomic transitions once it is on the queue:
 *  * incremented by (queue->subscriptions - untagged value)
 *  * decremented by 1, as each subscriber is finished with it
 *
 * The result of this is that the value cannot be zero until all subscribers have finished with it AND
 * it's subscriber count has been incremented by publishing. This allows us to use a message->subscriptions
 * value of zero as a definitive indication that the message is finished with.
 *
 * Complexity is introduced by subscriptions and unsubscriptions. In these cases we need to ensure that the
 * message->subscriptions value is consitent with the actual number of subscribers that will process it.
 *
 * In order to maintain the consistency between number and state of subscribers and the message subscriptions
 * we need to know exactly which message is the last queued before we update the global queue->subscriptions
 * value. This is done via two-phase tagging, full serialization of subscribe/unsubscribe and a guarantee of
 * strict time ordering in the subscription counts of messages on the queue.
 *
 * Tags are values of a magnitude such that no combination of the atomic transitions that are applied to a
 * messages count will cause it to be a valid value for a messages subscription count given the current number
 * of subscribers. We use a positive tag for subscription and negative for unsubscription to aid in debugging.

 *				NOTE: *subscription == NULL is currently not allowed due to issues with cleanup on unsubscribe.
 * start - the message to start processing from, this can be three things:

 *		 2. NULL - this indicates that processing should start at the current tail of the queue
 *		 3. a pointer to a message on the queue. If the message can't be found the behavior is as if
