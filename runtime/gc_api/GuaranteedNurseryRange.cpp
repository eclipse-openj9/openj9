/**
 * Answer the region of address space which is guaranteed to only ever contain objects in the nursery.
 * The GC will attempt to answer the largest range it can. The range may extend beyond the end of the
 * heap (to the end of the address range) if the GC can guarantee that no other heap objects will appear
 * in that area. Note that stack allocated objects may appear in the nursery range.
 *
 * If there is no nursery, or no part of its range can be guaranteed, start and end are both set to NULL.
 *
 * If the guaranteed nursery range extends to the bottom of the address range, start will be NULL and end 
 * will be the highest nursery address.
 *
 * If the guaranteed nursery range extends to the top of the address range, start will be the lowest nursery
 * address and end will be (void*)UDATA_MAX.
 *
 * Since the nursery may grow and contract during the JVM's lifetime, this range might cover only a very
 * small portion of the heap (typically about 4MB).
 *
 * Various features may cause the nursery range to be bounded on both ends. These include:
 *  - shared objects in Zero
 *  - non-flat memory model (e.g. some Vich configurations)
 *  - RTJ scopes
 *  - resman regions
 *
 * @param[in] javaVM the J9JavaVM* instance
 * @param[out] start the start address is returned in this pointer
 * @param[out] end the end address is returned in this pointer
 * 
 * @note this function is used by the JIT for barrier ommission optimizations
