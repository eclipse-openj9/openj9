         TITLE 'j9vm31floatstubs'
**********************************************************************
* This file contains a set of stub functions with the sole
* intention of loading and storing float/double from/to FPR0.
* However, since the OS Linkage dictates FPR0 is the incoming
* param and outgoing return floating point register, these
* functions are actually NOPs.  Ideally, we just generate
* inline assembly code from the C code (j9cel4ro64 in this case)
* once build compiler is upgraded.

J9VM_STE CSECT
J9VM_STE AMODE ANY
J9VM_STE RMODE ANY
         EDCPRLG
* This routine is to extract FPR0 as a float
* however, since OS linkage returns FPR0 anyways
* this is a nop routine to trick compiler in
* extracting return value from FPR0.
         EDCEPIL
         END

J9VM_STD CSECT
J9VM_STD AMODE ANY
J9VM_STD RMODE ANY
         EDCPRLG
* This routine is to extract FPR0 as a double
* however, since OS linkage returns FPR0 anyways
* this is a nop routine to trick compiler in
* extracting return value from FPR0.
         EDCEPIL
         END

J9VM_LE CSECT
J9VM_LE AMODE ANY
J9VM_LE RMODE ANY
         EDCPRLG
* This routine is to store FPR0 with a float
* parameter.  However, since OS linkage uses
* FPR0 as the parm, this is a nop routine
* to trick the compiler in doing it for us.
         EDCEPIL
         END

J9VM_LD CSECT
J9VM_LD AMODE ANY
J9VM_LD RMODE ANY
         EDCPRLG
* This routine is to store FPR0 with a double
* parameter.  However, since OS linkage uses
* FPR0 as the parm, this is a nop routine
* to trick the compiler in doing it for us.
