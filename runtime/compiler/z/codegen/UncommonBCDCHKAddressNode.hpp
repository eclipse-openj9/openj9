/**
 * \brief The Uncommon BCDCHK Address Node codegen phase is designed to cope with incorrect OOL PD copy problem
 * that arises due to canonicalization/restructuring of BCDCHK tree.
 *
 * This codegen phase happens right before instruction selection phase to uncommon certain address nodes,
 * done by optimizations such as LocalCSE, under BCDCHK node.
 *
 *
 * The new and canonical BCDCHK tree should be of the following format:
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * BCDCHK
 *      pdOpNode            (e.g. pdshloverflow)
 *      addressNode         (address into a byte[] object)
 *          arrayNode       (byte[] itself)
 *          offset          (offset into the byte[]. usually the header size plus another offset)
 *      callParam-1
 *      ...
 *      callParam-n
 *
 *
 * pdstorei
 *      =>addressNode       (same addressNode as above)
 *      =>pdOpNode          (same pdOpNode as above)
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * For the BCDCHK tree, the only node being evaluated in the mainline code is the pdOpNode, which is the
 * only one that can cause exceptions. For example, pdshlOverflow can be evaluated to SRP which can cause HW
 * decimal overflow exception.
 *
 * We make a function call in the out-of-line section to the original DAA API function to handle exceptions in the mainline.
 * To achive this, we make use of the addressNode and the callParam-x nodes attached to the BCDCHK node.
 * In OOL section evaluation, we make a callNode with callParam 1-n attached to it; after the call, the correct pdOpNode
 * results need to be copied from the addressNode location to the pdOpNode storage reference. This copying makes
 * sure its following pdstorei (usually right after the BCDCHK node) is copying the correct content; and is only done correctly
 * if the BCDCHK's addressNode and pdstorei's addressNode are uncommoned (decoupled).
