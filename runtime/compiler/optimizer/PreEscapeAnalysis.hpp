/**
 * The \c TR_PreEscapeAnalysis optimization looks for calls to
 * \c OSRInductionHelper and adds a fake \c prepareForOSR call
 * that references all live auto symrefs and pending pushes.  Any object
 * that ends up as a candidate for stack allocation that appears to be
 * used by such a fake \c prepareForOSR call can be heapified at that
 * point.
 *
 * During \ref TR_EscapeAnalysis (EA) itself, those references on
 * \c prepareForOSR calls are marked as ignoreable for the purposes
 * of determining whether an object can be stack allocated.
 *
 * After EA, the \ref TR_PostEscapeAnalysis pass will remove the fake
 * calls to \c prepareForOSR.
