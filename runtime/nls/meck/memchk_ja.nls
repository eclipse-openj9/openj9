# This file uses printf style substitutions. Sequences such as %s, %.*s, %10d
# etc. will be substituted at runtime. The special case of %% is not a substitution.
# It indicates a single percent sign. Please do not modify the format specifiers, or
# change their order. For instance, in a message like "from %d to %s", %d
# MUST appear before %s in any translated message, or a run-time crash
# could occur. This is a known limitation of the product.
