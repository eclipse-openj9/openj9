/**
 * @defgroup VMInterface VM Interface
 * @brief The C VM Interface between \ref ClearNatives "Clear JCL natives" and the Java VM.
 *
 * The VM Interface must be implemented by the JVM vendor to support the \ref ClearNatives "Clear JCL natives".
 * The VM vendor must export the following <a href='vmi_8h.html#VMIExports'>functions</a> from 
 * the VM-Interface shared library.  The JVM vendor is free to add additional exports to this
 * library for initialization purposes.
 *
 * The current implementation contains several temporary <a href='vmi_8h.html#VMITemporary'>functions</a>
 * that will be removed in an upcoming revision.  The implementation of these temporary functions
 * is trivial and described in the individual function comments.
