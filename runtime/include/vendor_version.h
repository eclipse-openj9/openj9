/* This file provides a means to supply vendor specific version info such as 
 * short name, SHA, and version string.
 * These vendor version info can be defined either in this file or other places.
 * 
 * Example usage for inclusion of a vendor name and repository sha.  These values
 * will be inserted into the java.fullversion and java.vm.info system properties
 * and in a generated javacore file.
 *
 * Note: The default Java full version string buffer size is 512, if the combined
 * length of VENDOR_SHORT_NAME and VENDOR_SHA (including white space and control
 * characters) is longer than 350 characters, please increase the buffer size at
 *     openj9/runtime/jcl/common/jclcinit.c - Line 74
