<h3>MurmurHash3</h3>

<p>MurmerHash3 is a 32 bit or 128 bit hashing algorithm, obtained from https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/master/src/MurmurHash3.cpp</p>

<p>
MurmurHash3 was written by Austin Appleby, and is placed in the public domain. The author hereby disclaims copyright to this source code.
</p>

<p>
Note - The x86 and x64 versions do _not_ produce the same results, as the algorithms are optimized for their respective platforms.
You can still compile and run any of them on any platform, but your performance with the non-native version will be less than optimal.
