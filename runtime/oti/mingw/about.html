<p>Portions of this software are derived from third-party works licensed
under terms compatible with the above MIT license:</p>
<p> 
(deleted terms related to files not included in this content).
</p>
<p> 
All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
interest of source tree size.
</p>
<p> 
All public header files (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) should be
treated as Public Domain as they intentionally contain no content
which can be covered by copyright. Some source modules may fall in
this category as well. If you believe that a file is so trivial that
it should be in the Public Domain, please contact the authors and
request an explicit statement releasing it from copyright.
</p>
<p> 
The following files are trivial, believed not to be copyrightable in
the first place, and hereby explicitly released to the Public Domain:
<ul>
<li>All public headers: include/*, arch/*/bits/*</li>
<li>Startup files: crt/*</li>
