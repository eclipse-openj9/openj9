 * This helpers could be written as macros (where the body of methods would be wrapped around oval parenthesis, which would mean that the last expression in the block
 * is return value of the block). However, it is not fully supported by ANSI, but only select C compilers, like GNU C: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Statement-Exprs.html).
 * Therefore, we are using inline methods to impletment the macros (in j9accessbarrier.h). The helpers are in separate file to resolve inter-file dependency (for example J9JavaVM
 * is not known type in j9accessbarrier.h).
