# CMake Getting Started / FAQ

## How to build with CMake

The CMake build system is designed to provide as seamless a transition as is possible.
As such, the normal OpenJ9 [build instructions](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/oj9_build.html)
can be followed with the following modifications:

- Ensure that CMake version 3.4 or greater is installed
  - The docker images will already have this provided
  - Windows users need to have the Cygwin CMake package via the Cygwin installer, rather than downloading
  the native windows version from the CMake website.
- Downloading freemarker is not required.
- Modify the provided configure command by:
  - removing the `--with-free-marker-jar=` argument
  - adding `--with-cmake`

:pencil: For more CMake info see [OMR CMake documentation](https://github.com/eclipse/omr/blob/master/doc/BuildingWithCMake.md)

## FAQ

### Why are only some targets installed via `install()`?
Generally only shared libraries / executables are installed. Static libraries are
not since they are considered temporary artifacts generated by the build.

:pencil: Here `install()` isn't being used in its normal sense. Here it's used
just to update the `rpath` (on applicable platforms) and to move the binary
to the corresponding source directory. We do this purely for compatability with
existing build infrastructure that expects the binaries to be laid out as they
would be under a `makefile` driven build.
