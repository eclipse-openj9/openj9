# CMake Getting Started / FAQ

:pencil: the information here is meant to supplement the
[OMR CMake documentation](https://github.com/eclipse/omr/blob/master/doc/BuildingWithCMake.md).

## FAQ

### Why are only some targets installed via `install()`?
Generally only shared libraries / executables are installed. Static libraries are
not since they are considered temporary artifacts generated by the build.

:pencil: Here `install()` isn't being used in its normal sense. Here it's used
just to update the `rpath` (on applicable platforms) and to move the binary
to the corresponding source directory. We do this purely for compatability with
existing build infrastructure that expects the binaries to be laid out as they
would be under a `makefile` driven build.
