# CMake Getting Started / FAQ

## How to build with CMake

The CMake build system is designed to provide as seamless a transition as is possible.
As such, the normal OpenJ9 [build instructions](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/oj9_build.html)
can be followed with the following modifications:

- Ensure that CMake version 3.5 or greater is installed
  - The docker images will already have this provided
  - Windows users need to have the Cygwin CMake package via the Cygwin installer, rather than downloading
    the native windows version from the CMake website.

:pencil: For more CMake info see [OMR CMake documentation](https://github.com/eclipse-omr/omr/blob/master/doc/BuildingWithCMake.md)

## Advanced: Building the vm without building openjdk

- Create build directory (its relation to the openj9/omr source trees is not important, however the openj9 directory should not be the same as the build directory)
- cd to the build directory
- Create an `openj9_version_info.h`, you can simply copy the template from the openjdk extensions repo, or run
```
cat > openj9_version_info.h << EOF
#ifndef OPENJ9_VERSION_INFO_H
#define OPENJ9_VERSION_INFO_H

#define J9COMPILER_VERSION_STRING "X"
#define J9PRODUCT_NAME            "X"
#define J9TARGET_CPU_BITS         "X"
#define J9TARGET_CPU_OSARCH       "X"
#define J9TARGET_OS               "X"
#define J9USERNAME                "X"
#define J9VERSION_STRING          "X"
#define OPENJDK_SHA               "X"
#define OPENJDK_TAG               "X"
#define J9JVM_VERSION_STRING      "X"
#define OPENJ9_TAG                "X"
#define J9JDK_EXT_VERSION         "X"
#define J9JDK_EXT_NAME            "X"

#endif /* OPENJ9_VERSION_INFO_H */
EOF
```
- Run the `cmake` command with the general form, `cmake -C <path_to_openj9>/runtime/cmake/caches/<spec>.cmake -DBOOT_JDK=<path_to_jdk>  -DJAVA_SPEC_VERSION=<java_version> -DOPENJ9_BUILD=ON -DJ9VM_OMR_DIR=<path_to_omr> <path_to_openj9>`
  - Both `path_to_omr` and `path_to_openj9` can be relative paths.
  - The `BOOT_JDK` argument can alternately be passed in via the `BOOT_JDK` environment variable.
  - Due to limitations of cmake on OSX, you must pass the location of the nasm via `-DCMAKE_ASM_NASM_COMPILER=/path/to/nasm`.
  - `-DOMR_DDR=ON` can be passed to enable ddr (the default is off).
  - `-G Ninja` can be passed to generate a ninja build system. Has the benefit of significantly faster partial rebuilds. (Note: J9 support here is still experimental)
- run `make [<target_name>]`, a list of targets can be obtained by running `make help`.

## FAQ

### Why are only some targets installed via `install()`?
Generally only shared libraries / executables are installed. Static libraries are
not since they are considered temporary artifacts generated by the build.

:pencil: Here `install()` isn't being used in its normal sense. Here it's used
just to update the `rpath` (on applicable platforms) and to move the binary
to the corresponding source directory. We do this purely for compatability with
existing build infrastructure that expects the binaries to be laid out as they
would be under a `makefile` driven build.
