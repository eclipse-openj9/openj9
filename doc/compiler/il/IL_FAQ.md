# Overview

This is a work in progress FAQ to capture questions and answers on TR's IL.
New entries will be added as questions are identified in issues, code reviews,
etc.  Over time this will become a comprehensive overview of TR IL.

## Do `monenter` & `monexit` trees have to be anchored to a 'treetop'?

### Detailed question:
From [issue 475](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/issues/475):
A log of `java/lang/StringBuffer.length()I` shows:
```
n13n      monent  jitMethodMonitorEntry[#178  helper Method]
n18n        ==>aRegLoad
...
n10n      treetop
n9n         monexit  jitMethodMonitorExit[#33  helper Method]
n18n          ==>aRegLoad
```
Is there a reason for this asymmetry between `monent` and `monexit`? Are there cases where `monexit` is not under a `treetop`?

### Answer:
Both `monenter` & `monexit` can be at the top level.  They are also allowed to be under a `treetop` as well.
They may show up under a `treetop` when they are under a `NULLCHK` that gets replaced by a `treetop`.
