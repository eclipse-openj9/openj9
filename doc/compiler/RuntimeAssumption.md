**Runtime assumption framework** is a key component of the Testarossa JIT 
compiler technology. It allows the optimizer to speculate what the mostly 
likely cases will be and generate faster code accordingly at compile time, 
while still maintaining functional correctness if any assumption is 
violated during run time.

The **lifetime of a runtime assumption** can be viewed in *three* stages:

1. The JIT optimizer makes assumptions on the state of a language runtime 
during method compilation and manages a set of internal data structures to 
keep track of the assumed runtime states.
2. If the assumptions remain valid at the end of method compilation, they 
are then saved into a *runtime assumption table* which persists beyond method 
compilation and into method execution. Some of the information in the data 
structures used in the previous stage also need to be saved into persistent 
memory so they can be accessed beyond method compilation.
3. If/When the assumed language runtime states change and assumptions are 
violated during method execution, the language runtime informs the runtime 
assumption table to notify the affected assumptions so they can perform 
necessary work to ensure correct program execution onward.

Please note that when a method compilation ends and the compiled method body 
is about to be committed to use, the language runtime will need to do final 
checks on its set of runtime assumptions. If some are violated during 
compilation, the language runtime can choose to perform work for those 
assumptions to maintain program correctness or fail the compilation. This is 
critical since no notifications about invalidation events will be given 
during method compilation -- only once a method is committed to the runtime 
and hooked up into its infrastructure.

The work every runtime assumption must perform when the assumption it holds 
is no longer true is called **compensation**. Compensation in Testarossa 
can be grouped into two main categories:

1. *Location redirection*: Patching at a particular location to unconditionally 
jump to a destination;
2. *Value modification*: Patching at a particular location to change its value 
to another value.

How a language runtime manages its assumed states during method compilation 
and method execution is up to the language runtime developers.

For J9, there is an important distinction between true runtime assumptions and
stop-the-world runtime assumptions. A true runtime assumption must be able to 
be patched while the application threads are executing (possibly even 
executing the instructions around the patch point). This means that the 
patching operations (whether it is patching to a location or modifying a 
value) must be atomic in the context of an executing instruction which 
generally imposes very strict patchability requirements. The stop-the-world 
assumptions are much less strict. The assumption in the JIT will be that 
any these guards can only be tripped at treetops that return true to 
canGCAndReturn or canGCAndExecpt, and that while at one of these trees and 
execution is halted guards may be patched. This is a much looser patching 
requirement (you can overwrite multiple instructions for example on x86). 
Currently HCR assumptions and OSR assumptions are considered 
stop-the-world for patching purposes and all others are considered to be 
true runtime assumptions.
