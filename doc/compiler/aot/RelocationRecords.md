This document describes at a high level what the various relocation records
are used for. The exact data stored into the SCC can be found in
`initializeCommonAOTRelocationHeader` and the various 
`initializePlatformSpecificAOTRelocationHeader` functions. Similarly, the 
exact type of the API class for each relocation kind can be found in
`TR_RelocationRecord::create`.
