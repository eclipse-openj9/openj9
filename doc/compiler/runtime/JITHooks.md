# Background

The VM has a mechansim to register callbacks for specific runtime event.
The JIT makes use of these events to perform tasks either for functional 
correctness, performance, or housekeeping. 

# Hooks
This section outlines various events or Hooks the JIT registers a callback
against. The callbacks associated with these Hooks can be found in
HookedByTheJit.cpp.

|Hook|Description|Comment|Locks Held<sup>1</sup>|
|--|--|--|--|
|`J9HOOK_VM_PROFILING_BYTECODE_BUFFER_FULL`|Notifies when the bytecode profiling buffer (consumed by the IProfiler) for a given thread is full.||VM Access, IProfiler Buffer Arrival Monitor|
|`J9HOOK_VM_LOOKUP_JNI_ID`|Notifies when a method or field ID is looked up via JNI.|The JIT uses this to get notified when `main` in the Java code is about to be run; it then unregisters this hook.|Exclusive VM Access|
|`J9HOOK_VM_INITIALIZE_SEND_TARGET`|Notifies when J9Methods are to have their send target initialized.|Used to set initial invocation counts.||
|`J9HOOK_MM_OMR_LOCAL_GC_START`|Notifies when a local Garbage Collection has started.|Local here applies to policies such as GenCon, where only the nursery region is being GC'd.|Exclusive VM Access|
|`J9HOOK_MM_OMR_LOCAL_GC_END`|Notifies when a local GC has ended|If Real Time GC is enabled, the JIT registers `jitHookLocalGCEnd`; otherwise it registers `jitHookReleaseCodeLocalGCEnd`.|Exclusive VM Access|
|`J9HOOK_MM_OMR_GLOBAL_GC_START`|Notifies when a global GC has started.|Global here implies a GC of the entire heap.|Exclusive VM Access|
|`J9HOOK_MM_OMR_GLOBAL_GC_END`|Notifies when a global GC has ended.|If Real Time GC is enabled, the JIT registers `jitHookGlobalGCEnd`; otherwise it registers `jitHookReleaseCodeGlobalGCEnd`.|Exclusive VM Access|
|`J9HOOK_MM_OMR_GC_CYCLE_END`|Notifies when the GC Cycle has ended.|The JIT only registers against this hook if Real Time GC is enabled.|Exclusive VM Access|
|`J9HOOK_VM_INTERNAL_CLASS_LOAD`|Notifies when a class has been loaded.||Class Table Mutex|
|`J9HOOK_VM_CLASS_PREINITIALIZE`|Notifies the initialization of a class prior to running the `<clinit>`.||Class Table Mutex|
|`J9HOOK_VM_CLASS_INITIALIZE`|Notifies the initialization of a class after running the `<clint>`.|||
|`J9HOOK_VM_CLASS_UNLOAD`|Notifies when a class has been unloaded.||Exclusive VM Access|
|`J9HOOK_VM_CLASSES_UNLOAD`|Notifies with the list of classes that have been unloaded.||Exclusive VM Access, Class Table Mutex, Compilation Monitor|
|`J9HOOK_VM_ANON_CLASSES_UNLOAD`|Notifies with the list of anonymous classes that have been unloaded. ||Exclusive VM Access|
|`J9HOOK_VM_CLASS_LOADER_UNLOAD`|Notifies with the list of classloaders that have been unloaded.|The JIT uses this hook to clean up the DLT buffers.|Exclusive VM Access|
|`J9HOOK_VM_CLASS_LOADERS_UNLOAD`|Notifies for each classloader that is unloaded.||Exclusive VM Access|
|`J9HOOK_MM_CLASS_UNLOADING_END`|Notifies that the GC has finished unloading classes.||Exclusive VM Access|
|`J9HOOK_MM_INTERRUPT_COMPILATION`|Notifies that JIT compilation should be interrupted in order for the GC to unload classes.|||
|`J9HOOK_VM_THREAD_CREATED`|Notifies when a thread has been created.|||
|`J9HOOK_VM_THREAD_DESTROY`|Notifies when a thread has been destroyed.|||
|`J9HOOK_VM_THREAD_STARTED`|Notifies when a thread has started running.|||
|`J9HOOK_VM_THREAD_END`|Notifies when a thread has finished running.|||
|`J9HOOK_VM_THREAD_CRASH`|Notifies when a thread has crashed.|||
|`J9HOOK_VM_JNI_NATIVE_REGISTERED`|Notifies when a native has been registered.||Assumption Table Mutex|

# Chronological Order of Hooks
Certain hooks will be invoked in a specific order because they relate to
a defined set of events that occur in the VM, for example GC. This
section outlines the order in which these hooks get triggered (assuming
no failures or error conditions).

## Garbage Collection
1. `J9HOOK_MM_OMR_GC_CYCLE_START`
2. `J9HOOK_MM_OMR_LOCAL_GC_START` or `J9HOOK_MM_OMR_GLOBAL_GC_START`
3. `J9HOOK_MM_OMR_LOCAL_GC_END` or `J9HOOK_MM_OMR_GLOBAL_GC_END`
4. `J9HOOK_MM_OMR_GC_CYCLE_END`

## Class Loading/Unloading
1. `J9HOOK_VM_INTERNAL_CLASS_LOAD`
2. `J9HOOK_VM_CLASS_PREINITIALIZE`
3. `J9HOOK_VM_CLASS_INITIALIZE`
4. `J9HOOK_VM_CLASS_UNLOAD`
5. `J9HOOK_VM_CLASSES_UNLOAD`
6. `J9HOOK_VM_ANON_CLASSES_UNLOAD`
7. `J9HOOK_VM_CLASS_LOADERS_UNLOAD`
8. `J9HOOK_VM_CLASS_LOADER_UNLOAD`

## Threads
1. `J9HOOK_VM_THREAD_CREATED`
2. `J9HOOK_VM_THREAD_STARTED`
3. `J9HOOK_VM_THREAD_END `
4. `J9HOOK_VM_THREAD_DESTROY`
