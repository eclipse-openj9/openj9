# Building JITServer

The build procedure for JITServer is nearly identical to a regular OpenJ9 build.

## Building the whole VM

Build instructions for different Java versions:

- [Java 8](../../build-instructions/Build_Instructions_V8.md)
- [Java 11](../../build-instructions/Build_Instructions_V11.md)
- [Java 16](../../build-instructions/Build_Instructions_V16.md)

To build with JITServer, pass `--enable-jitserver` option to the `configure` script.

## Building compiler only

Same instructions as [here](../../build-instructions/Build_Compiler_Only.md),
but to build with JITServer set the environment variable `J9VM_OPT_JITSERVER` to `1`.
