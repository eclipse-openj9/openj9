# Testing JITServer

There are currently 2 supported test procedures. Select the one that best suits your neeeds.

- [Testing locally](#local). Choose this if you have build & test dependencies set up.
- [Testing in Docker](#docker). Choose this if you don't want to deal with build & test dependency setups.

## LOCAL

These are the steps to run the tests on your machine.

1. Compile a build of openj9 from scratch. (Optional: compile a debug build if you need it. To do this pass the flag `--with-debug-level=slowdebug` to `configure`.
   Please note that debug build is much slower and the tests will take very long time to finish).

2. Install [prerequisites](https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/blob/master/test/docs/Prerequisites.md)

   An example of how to install the prerequisites can be found [here](https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/blob/master/buildenv/docker/test/Dockerfile#L57-L68). Make sure that JAVA_HOME and JAVA_BIN are set (E.g. `export JAVA_HOME=/root/openj9-openjdk-jdk11/build/linux-x86_64-normal-server-release/images/jdk` and `export JAVA_BIN=/root/openj9-openjdk-jdk11/build/linux-x86_64-normal-server-release/images/jdk/bin`). Basically you want to test on the jdk you build, so point the environment variable to your personal build of jdk.

3. Compile the tests (only need to compile once):

   ```
   cd $OPENJ9_DIR/openj9/test
   git clone https://github.com/adoptium/TKG.git
   cd TKG
   export TEST_JDK_HOME=<path to JDK directory that you wish to test, it's the same as $JAVA_HOME>
   export JAVA_BIN=/your/sdk/jre/bin
   export SPEC=linux_x86-64_cmprssptrs
   ```

   Either `TEST_FLAGS` or `EXTRA_OPTIONS` can be used to run tests with JITServer. The following will launch both the server and the client during the test.

   ```
   export TEST_FLAG="JITAAS"
   ```

   The following sets up only the client side which requires manually starting the server before running the test.

   ```
   export EXTRA_OPTIONS=" -XX:+UseJITServer " # spaces at the start and end are important!
   ```

   NOTE: It's important to put spaces before and after `-XX:+UseJITServer`, otherwise
   some tests will not run properly.

   Set the path to native test libraries, otherwise some tests will not run properly

   ```
   export NATIVE_TEST_LIBS=/root/buildname/openj9-openjdk-jdk8/build/linux-x86_64-normal-server-release/images/test/openj9
   ```

   Compile the test

   ```
   make compile
   ```

   NOTE: to compile and run tests, ant-contrib.jar is needed, and on some systems just installing ant will not install ant-contrib.
   On Ubuntu, the easiest way to get it is to run:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install ant-contrib
   ```

4. Run the tests!

   Manually start the server if `JITAAS` TEST_FLAG is not used.

   ```
   $JAVA_BIN/jitserver
   ```

   ```
   make _sanity
   ```

5. To rerun the failed tests, run

   ```
   make _failed
   ```

   which tests will be rerun can be modified in `failedtargets.mk`.

   or, if you want to run an individual test, run

   ```
   make <name_of_the_test>
   ```
