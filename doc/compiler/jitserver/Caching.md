# Caching in JITServer

Server-side caching is an important aspect of `JITServer` and one of the main reasons why `JITServer` client consumes less CPU time compared to local compilation. This document will explain why caching is important, what kind of entities we cache, and provide examples of how some caches work.

2. [Types of caching](#types-of-caching)
3. [Important caches](#important-caches)
4. [Cache control](#cache-control)

## Importance of caching

When server is compiling a method, it needs to know a lot of information that is located on the client side, e.g. the addresses of RAM classes, GC mode and its parameters, class hierarchy information, interpreter profiling data and much more.
To obtain this information, server will make a remote call over the network to the client, client will find it, and send it back to the server. During the course of a compilation server will make hundreds of such calls (on average), assuming no caching is done.
The number of messages per compilation will scale with the size of method being compiled and optimization level.

This is bad because remote calls have to go through the network, and many data structures cannot be sent directly and require serialization/deserialization.
These are expensive operations, both in terms of latency and CPU. If the server makes hundreds of requests to the client just for one compilation, client will spend more CPU time just sending and receiving data over the network than it would take for it to compile a method locally.
What makes it worse is that in order for the client to fetch the requested data it needs to do some work, which additionally increases CPU consumption.

Caching helps alleviate this problem by storing the result of frequent remote calls on the server, so that if the same data is needed again, it can accesss it from the cache, instead of making a remote call.

## Types of caching

There are 2 types of caching that JITServer does: global and per-compilation.

- Global caching (in persistent memory) is done for entities that will not change (or are very unlikely to change) over the lifetime of a client JVM, e.g. GC mode, IProfiler data for compiled methods, parent class of a J9 class, etc. Data stored in global caches will persist across multiple compilations or until the Java class it's describing is unloaded/redefined.
- Local caching (on the compilation heap) is done for entities that are not going to change during the current compilation, but might change in-between compilations or are just unique for each compilation, e.g. resolved methods are created anew for each compilation. We also use local caching for entities that can change, but are unlikely to do so during the limited life span of the current compilation, e.g. IProfiler data for interpreted methods. Since method is still interpreted, new profiling data might be added, but it's unlikely to change significantly enough to affect performance over the duration of the current compilation.

Both types of caching are done on per-client basis, that is, if multiple clients are connected to the same server, they will not share caches, as that would make entities very complicated. There is one exception: when an option `-XX:+JITServerShareROMClasses` is specified on the server, cached ROM classes can be shared between different clients.

Whenever possible, caching should be done globally, because hit rates will be higher, but one should be careful and make sure that the client data will not actually change.

Per-compilation caching makes sense only if the cached data is going to be accessed multiple times during the current compilation.

## Important caches

### `ClientSessionData`

Stores all of the globally cached data; for a detailed description read [this](ClientSession.md).

### `CompilationInfoPerThreadRemote`

Most of the per-compilation caches are stored in `CompilationInfoPerThreadRemote`. Since most caches have very similar structure, i.e. hash map, we added templated methods for working with these caches. The methods are `initializePerCompilationCache`, `cacheToPerCompilationMap`, `getCachedValueFromPerCompilationMap`, `clearPerCompilationCache`. If a new cache is added, it should use these methods. At the end of compilation all local caches need to be reset by adding a call to `TR::CompilationInfoPerThreadRemote::clearPerCompilationCaches`.

Some important per-compilation caches:

#### `TR_ResolvedMethodInfoCache`

This cache stores pointers to resolved methods created for the current compilaton. It is important, because messages requesting the creation of resolved methods are some of the most frequent messages. Unfortunately, persistent caching does not seem possible, since every compilation creates its own resolved methods. For more information on resolved method caching, read [this](ResolvedMethod.md).

#### `IPTableHeap_t`

This cache stores IProfiler data for methods whose profiling data might get updated. It is one of the two caches used by IProfiler.

- Per-compilation cache: stores data for interpreted methods and a method currently being compiled. It is a nested hash table. The outer cache uses `IPTableHeap_t` hash table type, and takes `J9Method *` as a key. The inner table uses `IPTableHeapEntry`, and takes bytecode index as a key, and stores profiling data as a value.
  It is possible for this cache to contain outdated profiling data, because IProfiler might collect additional data on the client after we cache it. However, the lifetime of a compilation is pretty short, so using suboptimal profiling information does not affect performance.
- Persistent cache: stores data for already compiled methods, because their interpreter profiling data will definitely not change.
  Uses a slightly different hash table type `IPTable_t`, because it's located inside entries of `J9MethodInfo`, so it only takes bytecode index as a key.

## Cache control

As mentioned previously, caching is used to optimize performance, so trying to
disable caching is not recommended.
There is no way to globally disable caching. However, you can specify environment variables to disable some caches.
This can be useful for debugging, if you suspect that a bug might be caused by invalid
data in some cache.

Available environment variables (subject to change):

- `TR_DisableResolvedMethodsCaching` - disables caching of resolved methods.
- `TR_DisableIPCaching` - disables caching of IProfiler entries.
