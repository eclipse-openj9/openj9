## Supported environments

OpenJ9 release 0.35.0 supports OpenJDK 8, 11, 17.

All releases are tested against the OpenJ9 functional verification (FV) test suite, the OpenJDK test suites, and additional tests provided by Adoptium.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](https://eclipse.org/openj9/docs/openj9_support/index.html).

## Notable changes in this release

The following table covers notable changes in v0.35.0. Further information about these changes can be found in the [user documentation](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/docs/version0.35/).

<td valign="top">OpenJDK 11 and later (Apple silicon macOS) </td>
<td valign="top">The remaining features, performance items, and bug fixes are implemented, making AArch64 (Apple silicon) macOS a production-ready target.</td>

<td valign="top"><a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/issues/15555">#15555</a></td>
<td valign="top"> Java&trade; dump output contains a new <tt>Initializing thread: &ltthread_name&gt</tt> string in the existing <tt>3XMTHREADBLOCK</tt> line.</td>
<td valign="top">All versions</td>
<td valign="top">For threads that are waiting for a class initialization lock, the Java dump output now shows the thread that is currently working to progress the initialization of the class.</td>

<td valign="top"><a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/issues/15636">#15636</a></td>
<td valign="top"> New <tt>user2</tt> event added for the <tt>-Xdump</tt> option</td>
<td valign="top">All versions (All operating systems except Windows&trade;)</td>
<td valign="top">On operating systems other than Windows, you can now use the <tt>user2</tt> event for the <tt>-Xdump</tt> option. The <tt>user2</tt> event is commonly used for taking system dump files with exclusive access without overriding the <tt>user</tt> event, which is generally left for taking Java dump files for performance investigations. </td>

<td valign="top"><a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/issues/14157">#14157</a></td>
<td valign="top">New <tt>-XX:[+|-]PerfTool</tt> option added</td>
<td valign="top">All versions (Linux&reg;)</td>
<td valign="top">This option enables or disables the JIT support for the <tt>perf</tt> tool without affecting the existing <tt>-Xjit</tt> options.</td>

<td valign="top"><a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/15444">#15444</a></td>
<td valign="top">New default options added in the <tt>options.default</tt> file</td>
<td valign="top">All versions</td>
<td valign="top">Objects that are created from classes <tt>Thread</tt> and <tt>Class</tt> are allocated in the tenure region directly and therefore, do not get moved by the garbage collector often. It takes time for such pre-tenured objects to get hashed and extended with a slot. To pre-hash those objects from the start and hence, improve performance, <tt>-XX:+EnsureHashed:java/lang/Class,java/lang/Thread</tt> is added to the list of default options in the <tt>options.default</tt> file.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/15217">#15217</a></td>
<td valign="top"> New options, <tt>-XX:JITServerMetricsSSLKey</tt> and <tt>-XX:JITServerMetricsSSLCert</tt>, added for encrypting the custom metrics with SSL or TLS</td>
<td valign="top">All versions (Linux)</td>
<td valign="top">These options specify the names of the files that contain the private TLS or SSL key and certificate that are used for authentication and encryption of the custom metrics.</td>

<td valign="top"><a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/15505">#15505</a></td>
<td valign="top"><tt>-XX:[+|-]JITServerLocalSyncCompiles</tt> enabled </td>
<td valign="top">All versions (Linux)</td>
<td valign="top">This option is now enabled in most cases to reduce the latency of the compilations that are performed synchronously. The option remains disabled when you specify <tt>-Xjit:count=0</tt> and in a few advanced use cases such as running the JVM in debug mode.</td>

<td valign="top"><a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/issues/15011">#15011</a></td>
<td valign="top">The default stack size is modified for the main thread</td>
<td valign="top">All</td>
<td valign="top">The main thread stack size was 1 MB in releases prior to 0.32. In the 0.32 release and later it's modified to a smaller
platform-dependent value, the same value as the <tt>-Xmso</tt> setting. The 0.33 release increases the default <tt>-Xmso</tt> stack size
on x64 platforms, but builds with OpenJDK 17 and later also require more stack space to run. These changes might result in a
<tt>java.lang.StackOverflowError: operating system stack overflow</tt>.</td>
<td valign="top">Use <tt>-Xmso</tt> to set the default stack size. See the default value by using <tt>-verbose:sizes</tt>.</td>

<td valign="top">Using the <tt>-XX:+ShowHiddenFrames</tt> option in an OpenJ9 release that is built with OpenJDK 18 and later causes errors due to underlying problems in OpenJDK</td>
<td valign="top">All platforms</td>
<td valign="top">Wrong exception might be thrown when using the Reflection API.</td>
<td valign="top">Avoid using the <tt>-XX:+ShowHiddenFrames</tt> option with OpenJDK 18 and later.</td>
