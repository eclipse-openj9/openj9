<tr><td valign="top">
<a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/issues/11999">#11999</a></td>
<td valign="top">New <strong>-XX:[+|-]AdaptiveGCThreading</strong> option added</td>
<td valign="top">All versions</td>
<td valign="top">Adaptive threading is enabled by default, which automatically tunes the number of active parallel garbage collection (GC) threads.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td valign="top">
<a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/12437">#12437</a></td>
<td valign="top">Improved time zone information added to Java dump files</td>
<td valign="top">All versions</td>
<td valign="top">Two new fields are included, the date and time in UTC (<strong>1TIDATETIMEUTC</strong>) and the time zone according to the local system (<strong>1TITIMEZONE</strong>).</td>
</tr>

<tr><td valign="top">
<a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/issues/7552">#7552</a></td>
<td valign="top">New default garbage collection (GC) scan ordering mode for the <tt>balanced</tt> policy</td>
<td valign="top">All versions</td>
<td valign="top">For performance improvements, GC copy forward operations in the <tt>balanced</tt> policy now use <i>dynamic breadth first scan mode</i>. To revert to the behavior in earlier releases, set <tt>-Xgc:breadthFirstScanOrdering</tt> on the command line when you start your application.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td valign="top">
<a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/12810">#12810</a></td>
<td valign="top">Stop parsing the <tt>JAVA_OPTIONS</tt> environment variable</td>
<td valign="top">All versions</td>
<td valign="top">The 0.24 release started parsing the <tt>JAVA_OPTIONS</tt> environment variable. This variable was added in error and has been removed.

<tr><td valign="top">
<a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/12501">#12501</a></td>
<td valign="top">Increase operating system stack size on PPC64 platforms</td>
<td valign="top">All JDK versions, AIX and Linux PPC64</td>
<td valign="top">The increased stack size leaves more room to store vector registers for internal linkage conventions. Note: This change increases the overall memory usage of the VM. You can change the stack size by using the -Xmso option.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td valign="top">
<a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/issues/12125">#12125</a></td>
<td valign="top">Global lock reservation is now enabled by default on Power</td>
<td valign="top">AIX and Linux on Power</td>
<td valign="top">Global lock reservation is now enabled by default on Power. This is an optimization targeted towards more efficient handling of locking and unlocking Java&trade; objects. The older locking behavior can be restored via the <tt>-XX:-GlobalLockReservation</tt> option.</td>

<tr><td valign="top">
<a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/issues/13194">#13194</a></td>
