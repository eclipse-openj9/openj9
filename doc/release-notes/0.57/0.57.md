## Supported environments

OpenJ9 release 0.57.0 supports OpenJDK 8, 11, 17, 21, and 25.

All releases are tested against the OpenJ9 functional verification (FV) test suite, the OpenJDK test suites, and additional tests provided by Adoptium.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](https://eclipse.org/openj9/docs/openj9_support/index.html).

## Notable changes in this release

The following table covers notable changes in v0.57.0. Further information about these changes can be found in the [user documentation](https://eclipse.dev/openj9/docs/version0.57/).

<td valign="top">All versions (All platforms except Windows&trade;)</td>
<td valign="top">On all platforms except Windows, when an asynchronous signal <tt>SIGABRT</tt>, <tt>SIGQUIT</tt>, or <tt>SIGUSR2</tt> occurs, the process ID (pid) and the name of the process that sent the signal is recorded and reported in a tracepoint and in the javacore.<br>The <tt>SIGINT</tt>, <tt>SIGHUP</tt>, and <tt>SIGTERM</tt> signals create a tracepoint that includes the pid but these signals do not create javacore files.<br>
On the z/OS&reg; platform, the pid is included in the tracepoint and reported in the javacore but the process name is not included.

<td valign="top">OpenJDK 11 (AIX)</td>
<td valign="top">A New Input/Output (NIO) channel selector provider, which is based on the pollset system facility, is implemented on AIX. The new implementation provides significant performance benefits when reading from, writing to, or managing multiple network sockets.

This feature is not enabled by default. You can configure it by specifying `-Djava.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider=sun.nio.ch.PollsetSelectorProvider` on the command line.

<tr>
<td valign="top"><a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/issues/23123">#15011</a></td>
<td valign="top">A feature that uses the x86-64 hardware and signal handler for improving the performance of null object checks and integer division overflows is temporarily disabled by default. VM crashes were observed on Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 and these crashes are suspected to be related to an interaction between the Windows control flow guard feature and the VM's signal handling mechanism.</td>
<td valign="top">Windows</td>
<td valign="top">Depending on the workload, performance degradation from 0-10% on Windows was observed with this feature disabled.</td>
<td valign="top">Disabling this signal handling optimization feature is a temporary measure while the root cause of the problem is determined. A reliable workaround cannot be recommended until the root cause is known.</td>

<td valign="top">The default stack size for the main thread is a smaller platform-dependent value.</td>
<td valign="top">All</td>
<td valign="top">The main thread stack size was 1 MB in releases before 0.32. In the 0.32 release and later it was modified to a smaller
platform-dependent value, the same value as the <tt>-Xmso</tt> setting. The 0.33 release increased the default <tt>-Xmso</tt> stack size
on x64 platforms, but builds with OpenJDK 17 and later also require more stack space to run. These changes might result in a
<tt>java.lang.StackOverflowError: operating system stack overflow</tt>.</td>
<td valign="top">Use <tt>-Xmso</tt> to set the default stack size. See the default value by using <tt>-verbose:sizes</tt>.</td>
