<td valign="top">All</td>
<td valign="top">The main thread stack size was 1 MB in releases before 0.32. In the 0.32 release and later it was modified to a smaller
platform-dependent value, the same value as the <tt>-Xmso</tt> setting. The 0.33 release increased the default <tt>-Xmso</tt> stack size
on x64 platforms, but builds with OpenJDK 17 and later also require more stack space to run. These changes might result in a
<tt>java.lang.StackOverflowError: operating system stack overflow</tt>.</td>
<td valign="top">Use <tt>-Xmso</tt> to set the default stack size. See the default value by using <tt>-verbose:sizes</tt>.</td>
