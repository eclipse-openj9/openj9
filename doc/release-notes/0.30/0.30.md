<td valign="top">Changes to the shared classes cache generation number</td>
<td valign="top">All versions</td>
<td valign="top">The format of classes that are stored in the shared classes cache is changed, which causes the JVM to create a new shared classes cache rather than re-creating or reusing an existing cache. To save space, you can remove all existing shared caches unless they are in use by an earlier release.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/13579">#13579</a></td>
<td valign="top">Java dumps now identify any command-line arguments that were ignored.</td>
<td valign="top">All versions</td>
<td valign="top">If any arguments are ignored, the group is introduced with <tt>1CIIGNOREDARGS</tt>, followed by a line beginning with <tt>2CIIGNOREDARG</tt> for each ignored argument.</td>

<td valign="top">New <tt>-XX:[+|-]EnsureHashed</tt> option added</td>
<td valign="top">All versions</td>
<td valign="top">This option specifies/unspecifies classes of objects that will be hashed and extended with a hash slot upon object creation or first move. This option may improve performance for applications that frequently hash objects of a certain type.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/12043">#12043</a></td>
<td valign="top">Redesigned balanced GC policy heap resizing</td>
<td valign="top">All versions</td>
<td valign="top">Eden and non-Eden heap resizing heuristics are redesigned to include more criteria (CPU overhead, heap occupancy, pause target time) and their relative sizing for fully expanded heap is made far more dynamic. A few existing command line options for fine tuning of resizing heuristics are now made avaialable for balanced GC policy, too.</td>
