<td valign="top">A new parameter <tt>maxstringlength</tt> is added to the <tt>-Xtrace</tt> option to specify the length of the string arguments and return values that are printed in trace output.</td>
<td valign="top">All versions</td>
<td valign="top">When you use the method tracing options, such as <tt>-Xtrace:methods={java/lang/String.concat'()'}</tt>, the argument is passed to the function as a string and the value is returned as a string. Earlier, you could not capture the contents of the string arguments and return values, only the address of the string object was printed. Now, both the actual strings as well as the addresses can be printed and with the new parameter, you can specify the length of the strings that are printed.</td>

<td valign="top">The default stack size for the main thread is a smaller platform-dependent value.</td>
<td valign="top">All</td>
<td valign="top">The main thread stack size was 1 MB in releases before 0.32. In the 0.32 release and later it was modified to a smaller
platform-dependent value, the same value as the <tt>-Xmso</tt> setting. The 0.33 release increased the default <tt>-Xmso</tt> stack size
on x64 platforms, but builds with OpenJDK 17 and later also require more stack space to run. These changes might result in a
<tt>java.lang.StackOverflowError: operating system stack overflow</tt>.</td>
<td valign="top">Use <tt>-Xmso</tt> to set the default stack size. See the default value by using <tt>-verbose:sizes</tt>.</td>
