<td valign="top">New option that affects the handling of the SIGABRT signal</td>
<td valign="top">OpenJDK8 and later</td>
<td valign="top">By default, the OpenJ9 VM handles SIGABRT signals and generates dump files. A new option is available to force OpenJ9 to match the
reference implementation, where the signal is handled by the default operating system handler. To match the reference implementation, set <tt>-XX:-HandleSIGABRT</tt>.</td>

<td valign="top">New option <tt>-XX:[+|-]PrintFlagsFinal</tt> for compatibility with the reference implementation</td>
<td valign="top">OpenJDK8 and later</td>
<td valign="top">This option provides output that lists configuration parameters for the OpenJ9 VM, such as the maximum heap size setting. The
implementation is currently incomplete and provides output on only a subset of configuration parameters.</td>

<td valign="top">macOS shared libraries version updated</td>
<td valign="top">OpenJDK8 and later (macOS&reg; only)</td>
<td valign="top">The version information for shared libraries on macOS has been updated from 0.0.0 to 1.0.0. If an application has linked against a shared library from a previous OpenJ9 release, it needs to be re-linked against the new release.</td>

<td valign="top">Change to the output of the <tt>NoClassDefFoundError</tt> exception message to match the reference implementation</td>
<td valign="top">OpenJDK8 and later</td>
