<td valign="top">Class data sharing for bootstrap classes is enabled by default</td>
<td valign="top">OpenJDK8 and later</td>
<td valign="top">Class data sharing is enabled by default for bootstrap classes, unless your application is running in a container. You can use the <tt>-Xshareclasses</tt> option to change the default behavior.</td>

<td valign="top">OpenJDK8 and later</td>
<td valign="top">Anonymous classes (defined by <tt>Unsafe.defineAnonymousClass</tt>) are now stored in the shared classes cache by default so that they are available for ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation. To
prevent these classes being shared, use the <tt>-XX:-ShareAnonymousClasses</tt> option.</td>

<td valign="top">Changes to the shared classes cache generation number</td>
<td valign="top">OpenJDK8 and later</td>
<td valign="top">The format of classes that are stored in the shared classes cache is changed. To save space, all existing shared caches can be removed unless they are in use by an earlier release. For more information about deleting a shared classes cache, see the <tt>-Xshareclasses</tt> option.</td>

<td valign="top">Support for Transparent HugePage allocation by default</td>
<td valign="top">OpenJDK8 and later (Linux on x86)</td>
<td valign="top">In release 0.15, support was introduced for Transparent HugePage on Linux when the <tt>madvise</tt> (<tt>/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled</tt>) setting is set by specifying the <tt>-XX:+TransparentHugePage</tt> option on the command line. This support is now enabled by default for Linux on x86 systems. </td>

<td valign="top">New <tt>jcmd</tt> tool</td>
<td valign="top">OpenJDK8 and later</td>
<td valign="top">For compatibility, OpenJ9 includes an independent implementation of the <tt>jcmd</tt> tool, which can run diagnostic commands on a specified VM or VMs.</td>

<td valign="top">Automatically setting an initial heap size by default</td>
<td valign="top">OpenJDK8 and later</td>
<td valign="top">In release 0.15, a new feature was introduced that allowed OpenJ9 to learn and set an appropriate initial heap size for an application as an alternative to a user manually sizing and setting an <tt>-Xms</tt> value. This feature could be enabled by setting the <tt>-XX:+UseGCStartupHints</tt> option on the command line. This
option is now enabled by default.</td>
