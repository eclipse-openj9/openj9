<td valign="top">OpenJDK 16</td>
<td valign="top">OpenJ9 adds option <strong>-XX:DiagnoseSyncOnValueBasedClasses=&lt;number&gt;</strong> for compatibility with the reference implementation. A value of <tt>1</tt> generates a <tt>VirtualMachineError</tt> error and a value of <tt>2</tt> prints a warning message.</td>

<td valign="top">Single build for compressed references and non-compressed references</td>
<td valign="top">All versions</td>
<td valign="top">A single build now supports both compressed references and non-compressed references. The object reference mode is selected at run time based on the specified heap size (<strong>-Xmx</strong>) or by using command-line options that control the selection of compressed references. If compressed references mode is automatically selected and you don't want to use compressed references, turn it off using the command-line option <strong>-Xnocompressedrefs</strong>.</td>

<td valign="top">All versions</td>
<td valign="top">On AIX systems that contain the Nest accelerator (NX) co-processor, OpenJ9 now uses the <tt>zlibNX</tt> library instead, if it is installed. The NX co-processor is available on IBM POWER9&reg; systems.</td>
