# Eclipse OpenJ9 Issue Labels

OpenJ9 has defined a number of different labels for managing issues.
Many of the labels are of the form `{category}:{subcategory}`.
The labels are defined below along with notes about their intended usage.

Priority
---
Describe the priority of the particular issue.

* `pri:high`
* `pri:medium`
* `pri:low`


JDK
---
Indicate if this issue is specific for a given JDK level, such as JDK8.

* `jdk8`
* `jdk9`
* `jdk10`
* `jdk11`


Component
---
Indicate the likely component for this issue.  Segregating by component
helps to keep the list of issues to review managable and to guide
contributors for a particular area to the relevant items.

* `comp:vm`
* `comp:jit`
* `comp:test`
* `comp:doc`
* `comp:gc`
* `comp:build`
* `comp:port`


Dependencies
---
OpenJ9 builds with several other projects: 'Eclipse OMR' & an 'OpenJDK
extensions for OpenJ9' repo for each JDK level.  These labels help to
identify dependent changes to ensure they are merged together or in the
correct order:

* `depends:omr`
* `depends:openjdk(8, 9, 10, 11)`
* `depends:EclipseCQ`: Indicate a change needs a Contributor Questionnaire

OpenJDK projects
---
Labels for issues related to OpenJDK projects and JEPs:

* `project:panama`
* `project:valhalla`
* `JEP`

Performance
---
Labels for issues that affect performance or footprint.

* `perf`
* `footprint`

External documentation
---
Label to indicate that a PR or issue requires external documentation (new feature / change in
  behavior / limitation).

* `doc:externals`

**Note:** When you use this label, you must open an [issue](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9-docs/issues/new?template=new-documentation-change.md) in the OpenJ9 documentation repo.

End User issues
---
To indicate an issue has been raised by an end user or affects the User-experience rather than being a developer-centric issue.

* `userRaised`
* `svtRaised`: Indicate an issue was raised for an AdoptOpenJDK 3rd party issue or the OpenJ9 system verification test (svt).
