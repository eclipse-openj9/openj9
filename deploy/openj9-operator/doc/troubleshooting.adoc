= Troubleshooting

Here are some basic troubleshooting methods to check if the operator is running fine:

* Run the following and check if the output is similar to the following:

[source,sh]
----
  $ oc get pods -l name=openj9-operator
  NAME                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  openj9-operator-5bdfc7bf98-jt87l   1/1       Running   0          60m
----

* Check the operators events:

[source,sh]
----
  $ oc describe pod openj9-operator-5bdfc7bf98-jt87l
----

* Check the operator logs:

[source,sh]
----
  $ oc logs openj9-operator-5bdfc7bf98-jt87l
----

If the operator is running fine, check the status of the `RuntimeComponent` Custom Resource (CR) instance:

* Check the CR status:

[source,sh]
----
  $ oc get runtimecomponent -o wide
  NAME            IMAGE                 EXPOSED   RECONCILED   REASON    MESSAGE   DEPENDENCIESSATISFIED   AGE
  sample-openj9   adoptopenjdk:openj9             True                             True                    33s
----

* Check the CR effective fields:

[source,sh]
----
  $ oc get runtimecomponent example-openj9 -o yaml
----

  Ensure that the effective CR values are what you want.

* Check the `status` section of the CR. If the CR was successfully reconciled, the output should look like the following:

[source,sh]
----
  $ oc get runtimecomponent sample-openj9 -o yaml
  apiVersion: open.j9/v1beta1
  kind: RuntimeComponent
  metadata:
    ...
  status:
    conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2020-08-18T01:58:51Z
      lastUpdateTime: 2020-08-18T01:58:52Z
      status: "True"
      type: DependenciesSatisfied
    - lastTransitionTime: 2020-08-18T01:58:52Z
      lastUpdateTime: 2020-08-18T01:58:52Z
      status: "True"
      type: Reconciled
    imageReference: adoptopenjdk:openj9
----

* Check the CR events:

[source,sh]
----
  $ oc describe runtimecomponent sample-openj9
----
