We're not sure which route you might have taken on your way here, but we're really pleased to see you! If you came directly from our website, you've probably already learned a lot about Eclipse OpenJ9 and how it fits in to the OpenJDK ecosystem. If you came via some other route, here are a few key links to get you started:

- [Eclipse OpenJ9 website](http://www.eclipse.org/openj9) - Learn about this high performance, enterprise-grade Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and why we think you want to get involved in its development.
- [AdoptopenJDK website](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk9-openj9) - Grab pre-built OpenJDK binaries that embed OpenJ9 and try it out.
- [Build instructions](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/oj9_build.html) - Here's how you can build an OpenJDK with OpenJ9 yourself.
- [FAQ](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/oj9_faq.html)

Hopefully you're here because you want to get involved in the project? Read on ...

What is the goal of the project?
================================

The long term goal of the Eclipse OpenJ9 project is to foster an open ecosystem of JVM developers that can collaborate and innovate with designers and developers of hardware platforms, operating systems, tools, and frameworks.

The project welcomes collaboration, embraces fresh innovation, and extends an opportunity to influence the development of OpenJ9 for the next generation of Java applications.

The Java community has benefited over its history from having multiple implementations of the JVM specification competing to provide the best runtime for your application.  Whether adding compressed references, new Cloud features, AOT (ahead of time compilation), or straight up faster performance and lower memory use, the ecosystem has improved through that competition.  Eclipse OpenJ9 aims to continue to spur innovation in the runtimes space.

How do I contribute?
