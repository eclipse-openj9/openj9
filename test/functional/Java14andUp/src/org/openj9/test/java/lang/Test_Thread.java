/**
 * This test is to verify matching behavior to the RI from the following implementation change
 * discussed in the Java 14 release notes:
 * 
 * "The specification for java.lang.Thread::interrupt allows for an implementation to only track the 
 * interrupt state for live threads, and previously this is what occurred. As of this release, the 
 * interrupt state of a Thread is always available, and if you interrupt a thread t before it is started, 
 * or after it has terminated, the query t.isInterrupted() will return true."
