	 * Check through the classic heapdump looking for the array of PackedMixedTwoRefs and 
	 * check the length. Also check the references. 
	 * 
	 * The essential point is that in the array we will see the references, not to the PackedMixedTwoRefs objects 
	 * as we would if this were a normal array, but the references to the objects to which the PackedMixed objects point. 
	 *  Hence we expect to see 20 references, not 10.
	 *  
	 * The expected output is similar to:
