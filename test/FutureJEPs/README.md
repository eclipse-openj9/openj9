# Future JEPs Test
- Contains [tests](src/org/openj9/test/panama/) for Project Panama native method handles
- Contains [tests](src/org/openj9/test/valhalla/) for Project Valhalla nest host & nest members attributes
- Build with the "Build git tests - experimental" job
- Run with linux_x86-64_cmprssptrs_futurejeps.spec on the rawbuild-futurejeps_xa64-b136 sdk
- [HigherLevelNativeMethodHandleTest](src/org/openj9/test/panama/HigherLevelNativeMethodHandleTest.java) uses [panamatest.jar](lib/panamatest.jar), created from [panamatest.c](panamatest.c) with the jextract groveller


    * To create a libpanamatest.so, a gcc is needed:

            gcc -shared -o {$common.workspace.gittest$}/Panama/libpanamatest.so -fPIC {$common.workspace.gittest$}/Panama/panamatest.c

    * To create a file like panamatest.jar, on a machine with os:linux:ubuntu14 capability (such as ub1404x64vm1), run:

            export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path_to_clang_lib>/clang/clang+llvm-3.8.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-14.04/lib
            <OpenJDK_root>/bin/jextract -J-Djava.library.path=<path_to_clang_lib>/clang -t panama.test -o panamatest.jar <path to the test repo>/Panama/panamatest.c
