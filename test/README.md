# How-to Run Tests
Prerequisites:

  * perl 5.10.1 or above with JSON and Text::CSV module installed
  * make 3.81 or above (recommend make 4.1 or above on windows)
  * wget 1.14 or above
  * ant 1.7.1 or above with ant-contrib.jar

Let's create the following scenario:
For the purpose of this example, we assume you have an OpenJ9 SDK ready for testing. Below are the specific commands you'd run to compile and run tests. Details are explained in *Tasks in OpenJ9 Test* section below.

```
cd openj9/test/TestConfig
export JAVA_BIN=<path to JDK bin directory that you wish to test>
export SPEC=linux_x86-64_cmprssptrs
make -f run_configure.mk
make test
```

# Tasks in OpenJ9 Test

1. Configure environment:
* required environment variables

```
JAVA_BIN=<path to JDK bin directory that you wish to test>
SPEC=[linux_x86-64|linux_x86-64_cmprssptrs|...] platform_on_which_to_test
JAVA_VERSION=[SE80|SE90] (SE90 default value)
```
  * list of dependent jars

	* asm-all-6.0_BETA.jar
	* commons-cli-1.2.jar
	* commons-exec-1.1.jar
	* javassist-3.20.0-GA.jar
	* junit-4.10.jar
	* testng-6.10.jar
	* jcommander-1.48.jar
	* asmtools-6.0.jar

	To get the above dependent jars, please run `make getdependency` . getdependency target will get called when running make compile or test target.

2. Compile tests:
  * compile and run all tests

            make test
  * only compile but do not run tests

            export BUILD_LIST=comma_separated_projects_to_be_compiled (defaults to all projects)
            make compile

3. Add more tests:
  * for Java8/Java9 functionality

	- If you have added new features to OpenJ9, you will likely need to add new tests. Check out openj9/test/TestExample for the format to use.

	- If you have many new test cases to add, then you may want to copy the TestExample project, change the name,replace the test examples with your own code, update the build.xml and playlist.xml files to match your new Test class names.

	- Most OpenJ9 FV tests are written with TestNG.  We leverage TestNG groups to create test make targets. This means that minimally your test source code should belong to either level.sanity or level.extended group to be included in main OpenJ9 builds.

4. Run tests:
  * all tests

            make test (to compile & run)
            make runtest (to run all tests without recompiling them)
  * sanity tests

            make sanity
  * extended tests

            make extended
  * external tests

            make external
  * perf tests

            make perf
  * openjdk tests

            make openjdk
  * a specific individual test

            make _generalExtendedTest_0
  * a directory of tests

            make test_NameOfTestDir  (for example: make test_Jsr292 or make test_cmdLineTests.verbosetest, where nested directories separated by '.')
  * component specific tests (WIP)
  * against an IBM Java8 SDK

	Same general instructions for Configure environment, and make test, but export JAVA_VERSION=SE80 explicitly before run_configure.mk step.
  * against an OpenJ9 Java 9 SDK

	No special steps to accomplish this, as JAVA_VERSION=SE90 by default, so simply need to Configure environment and run make test.
  * against a Java8 or Java9 OpenJDK/Oracle JDK (WIP)

	We are annotating the OpenJ9 specific tests, so that they will be excluded from compilation and execution against an implementation that they are not intended to test.
  * rerun the failed tests from the last run

            make failed
  * with a different set of JVM options

	There are 3 ways to add options to your test run:

	- If you simply want to add an option for a one-time run, you can either override the original options by using JVM_OPTIONS="your options".
	- If you want to append options to the set that are already there, use EXTRA_OPTIONS="your extra options". Below example will append to those options already in the make target.

            make _jsr292_InDynTest_SE90_0 EXTRA_OPTIONS=-Xint
	- If you want to change test options, you can update playlist.xml in the corresponding test project.
5. Exclude tests:
  * temporarily on all platforms

    Depends on the JAVA_VERSION, add a line in the test/TestConfig/resources/excludes/latest_exclude_$(JAVA_VERSION).txt file. It is the same format that the OpenJDK tests use, name of test, defect number, platforms to exclude.

    To exclude on all platforms, use generic-all.  For example:

```
org.openj9.test.java.lang.management.TestOperatingSystemMXBean:testGetProcessCPULoad 121187 generic-all
```

Note that we additionally added support to exclude individual methods of a test class, by using :methodName behind the class name (OpenJDK does not support this currently). In the example, only the testGetProcessCPULoad method from that class will be excluded (on all platforms/specs).
  * temporarily on specific platforms or architectures

    Same as excluding on all platforms, you add a line to latest_exclude_$(JAVA_VERSION).txt file, but with specific specs to exclude, for example:
```
org.openj9.test.java.lang.management.TestOperatingSystemMXBean 121187 linux_x86-64
```
This example would exclude all test methods of the TestOperatingSystemMXBean from running on the linux_x86-64 platform.
Note: in OpenJ9 the defect numbers would associate with git issue numbers (OpenJDK defect numbers associate with their bug tracking system).
  * permanently on all or specific platforms/archs

    For tests that should NEVER run on particular platforms or architectures, we should not use the default_exclude.txt file. To disable those tests, we annotate the test class to be disabled. To exclude MyTest from running on the aix platform, for example:
```
@Test(groups={ "level.sanity", "component.jit", "disabled.os.aix" })
	public class MyTest {
	...
```
We currently support the following exclusion groups:
```
disabled.os.<os> (i.e. disabled.os.aix)
disabled.arch.<arch> (i.e. disabled.arch.ppc)
disabled.bits.<bits> (i.e. disabled.bits.64)
disabled.spec.<spec> (i.e. disabled.spec.linux_x86-64)
```
6. View results:
  * in the console

    OpenJ9 tests take advantage of the testNG logger.
    If you want your test to print output, you are required to use the testng logger (and not System.out.print statements). In this way, we can not only direct that output to console, but also to various other clients (WIP).  At the end of a test run, the results are summarized to show which tests passed / failed / skipped.  This gives you a quick view of the test names and numbers in each category (passed/failed/skipped).  If you've piped the output to a file, or if you like scrolling up, you can search for and find the specific output of the tests that failed (exceptions or any other logging that the test produces).
  * in html files

    Html (and xml) output from the tests are created and stored in a test_output_xxxtimestamp folder in the TestConfig directory (or from where you ran "make test").  The output is organized by tests, each test having its own set of output.  If you open the index.html file in a web browser, you will be able to see which tests passed, failed or were skipped, along with other information like execution time and error messages, exceptions and logs from the individual test methods.
  * in the cloud (WIP)
7. Attach a debugger:
  * to a particular test

    The command line that is run for each particular test is echo-ed to the console, so you can easily copy the command that is run.
    You can then run the command directly (which is a direct call to the java executable, adding any additional options, including those to attach a debugger.
8. Move test into different make targets (layers):
  * from extended to sanity (or vice versa)

    Change the group annotated at the top of the test class from "level.extended" to "level.sanity" and the test will be automatically switched from the extended target to the sanity target.
