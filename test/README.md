# Quick Start

Below is an example to run all sanity.functional tests against a JDK8
Linux x86-64 cmprssptrs OpenJ9 SDK:

```
    cd openj9/test/TestConfig
    export JAVA_BIN=/my/openj9/sdk/bin
    export SPEC=linux_x86-64_cmprssptrs
    make -f run_configure.mk   // generates makefiles
    make compile               // downloads test related material/libs
                               // and compiles test material
    make _sanity.functional    // runs tests
```

Please read [OpenJ9 Test User Guide](./docs/OpenJ9TestUserGuide.md) for
details and other examples.  For example, if you wish to test a JDK11 version, 
you would export JDK_VERSION=11 (default JDK_VERSION=8).

## Prerequisites:
Please read [Prerequisites.md](./docs/Prerequisites.md) for details on
what tools should be installed on your test machine to run tests.

# FAQ

While the [OpenJ9 Test User Guide](./docs/OpenJ9TestUserGuide.md) gives
a more complete list of OpenJ9 test use cases, there are some
frequently asked questions or common use cases by OpenJ9 developers
listed below.

## 1) How to compile tests in selected directories?

By default, `make compile` compiles all tests. This is the safest way
to ensure all the test code needed has been compiled. However, there is a
way to shortcut the compilation process to reduce compilation time. If
`BUILD_LIST` is set, `make compile` will only compile the folder names
names that match within `BUILD_LIST`.

```
    export BUILD_LIST=functional/TestUtilities,functional/Java8andUp
    make compile
```

## 2) How to add a test?

### Add FV (functional) test
Adding a testNG test as an example:
- adding a single test class to an existing directory
    - update testng.xml to add the test class to a existing <test> or
    create a new <test>
    - If the new <test> is created in testng.xml, playlist.xml should
    be updated to add the new <test> based on [playlist.xsd](./TestConfig/playlist.xsd)
    Supported test groups are `functional|system|openjdk|external|perf|jck`.
    It is required to provide one group per test in playlist.xml.
- adding additional new test methods for new Java10 functionality
    - test should be automatically picked up

### Add external test
Please refer to the [video and tutorial](https://blog.adoptopenjdk.net/2018/02/adding-third-party-application-tests-adoptopenjdk)
that describes how to add container-based 3rd party application tests
(run inside of Docker images). These tests are added and run in the
automated test builds at the AdoptOpenJDK project.

## 3) How to disable a test?
In playlist.xml, to disable a test target, add

 ```
    <disabled>Reason for disabling test, should include issue number</disabled>
 ```

inside the `<test>` element that you want to disable.

- Disable an individual test class
    - testNG test
add a line to `TestConfig/resources/excludes/latest_exclude_$(JDK_VERSION).txt`
 file with issue number and specific specs to disable
```
    org.openj9.test.java.lang.management.TestOperatingSystemMXBean 123 linux_x86-64
```

## 4) How to execute a different group of tests?

Test can be run with different levels, groups or combination of
level.group.

Supported levels are `sanity|extended`

Supported groups  are `functional|system|openjdk|external|perf|jck`

```
    make _sanity
    make _functional
    make _extended.perf
```

## 5) How to execute a directory of tests?

The example below executes all of the sanity tests found within the
JIT_Test directory

```
    make -C ../functional/JIT_Test -f autoGen.mk _sanity
```
or
```
    cd ../functional/JIT_Test; make -f autoGen.mk _sanity
```

## 6) How to run an individual JCK?

Please read [How-to Run customized JCK test targets](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/blob/master/jck/README.md) for details.

## 7) How to run the test with different `JDK_VERSION` and `JDK_IMPL`?

User can run tests against different java version and/or java
implementation. While the default values of these variables match a
typical use case for OpenJ9 developers, there are also many cases
where developers need to verify features for a specific version or
compare behaviour against a particular implementation.

JDK_VERSION=[8|9|10|11|Panama|Valhalla] (8 default value)

JDK_IMPL=[openj9|ibm|hotspot|sap] (openj9 default value)

```
    export JDK_VERSION=8
    export JDK_IMPL=hotspot
```

## 8) How to interpret test results?
- test results summary

At the end of each run, test results summary will be printed:

```
    TEST TARGETS SUMMARY
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    PASSED test targets:
        cmdLineTester_javaAssertions_0
        cmdLineTester_LazyClassLoading_0
        ...
    FAILED test targets:
        TestAttachAPIEnabling_SE80_0
        TestFileLocking_SE80_0

    TOTAL: 84   EXECUTED: 84   PASSED: 82   FAILED: 2   SKIPPED: 0
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
```

You can find the failed test output in console output.

- TAP result

A simple standardized TAP output is produced at the end of a test run,
to provide developers with a convenient summary of the test results.
It is also necessary as the tests used to verify OpenJ9 use a variety
of test output formats. This summary is a way to standardize the output
which allows CI tools to present results in a common way.

- `SKIPPED` tests

If a test is skipped, it means that this test cannot be run on this
platform due to jvm options, platform requirements and/or test
capabilities.

## 9) How to rerun failed tests?

`failed.mk` will be generated if there is any failed test target.
We can rerun failed tests as following:

```
    make _failed
```

`failed.mk` will be over-written each test run. If you want to
'save it', you can make a copy of the generated `failed.mk` file.
