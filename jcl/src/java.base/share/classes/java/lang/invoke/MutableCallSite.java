		/* The JIT performs aggressive optimizations relying on the assumption
		 * that this.target points at a handle that is equivalent to the value it
		 * found in this.epoch at the time of the compilation.  If this.target is
		 * ever changed to a non-equivalent handle, we must first compensate the
		 * assumptions to ensure that we never run unsuitable code on the new target.
		 *
		 * Ensuring this in a multithreaded system, where the compile thread is
		 * concurrent with the application threads, requires synchronization.  At
		 * the end of compilation, the JIT does the so-called "CHTable commit":
		 * the JIT acquires the CHTable (Class Hierarchy Table) lock, and then
		 * checks whether all the assumptions it made during compilation are
		 * still valid.  If they are valid, it registers the assumptions to be
		 * compensated later if the assumptions are ever violated; if the
		 * assumptions have already been violated, the JIT compensates the
		 * assumptions immediately.
		 *
		 * The invalidate() call acquires the same lock and performs the
		 * compensation.  Because it acquires the same lock, it will run either
		 * before or after any CHTable commit.  If it runs before, there will be
		 * no assumptions to compensate.  If it runs after, it will compensate
		 * precisely those assumptions that the commit process registered (and
		 * hence were not compensated by the JIT itself).
		 *
		 * For this to work with MCS target / epoch assumptions, it is CRUCIAL
		 * that there exists no window during which the CHTable commit can observe
		 * a value of this.epoch that is not equivalent to this.target.  If the
		 * CHTable commit ever observed such a state, it could incorrectly
		 * conclude that there is no need to compensate the assumptions.
		 *
		 * The protocol we have works as follows:
		 *   1. this.epoch  = null
		 *   2. this.target = newTarget
		 *   3. this.epoch  = newTarget
		 *
		 * With all these fields being volatile, the only possible way for epoch
		 * not to match target is if epoch is null.  This case is easy to check
		 * in the JIT code, and we deal with nulls appropriately there.  This
		 * is the only code anywhere that modifies the target or epoch fields,
		 * and this method is synchronized, so there is no race between different
		 * threads doing setTarget at the same time.
		 *
		 * The remaining question is, where is the appropriate place to call
		 * invalidate?  The core design of CHTable commit is that either it must
		 * do the assumption compensation itself, or it must register assumptions
		 * to be compensated later.  This design only works properly if the
		 * compensation will indeed be done later.  Hence, if we call invalidate
		 * before step #1, it would be too early, because there would be a window
		 * (right before step #1) where the CHTable commit would not yet see any
		 * reason to do the compensation immediately, and it would respond by
		 * registering an assumption to compensate later, yet the thread
		 * performing the setTarget would never compensate that assumption
		 * because it already did its check and found nothing to compensate.
		 *
		 * Hence, the call to invalidate must occur after the CHTable code is made aware
		 * that it needs to do the compensation, and that occurs in step #1.
		 *
		 * Furthermore, the design of invalidate is that it must occur before
		 * this.target actually changes.  Otherwise, the jitted code can continue
		 * to execute code that is incorrect when fed the new target handle.
		 * Hence, the invalidate call must occur before step #2.
		 *
		 * Therefore, the invalidate call can only go between steps #1 and #2.
